# Lox

An object oriented programming language, made by [Robert Nystrom](https://craftinginterpreters.com/)

## About

Lox is an interpreted language, with strings supported.

## Usage

Firstly, `cd` into this folder.

1. **REPL**
   You can run Lox as a REPL by providing no command line arguments.

```bash
> ./clox
```

2. **Run a file**
   Provide the filename as the first argument to execute the lox program saved as that file. You can try the test file `z_test.lox`.

```bash
> ./clox z_test.lox
```

Since I have built this on Windows, you'll have to run `make` first to build for your OS and follow the above steps.
